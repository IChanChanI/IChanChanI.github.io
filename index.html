<section id="Welcome">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p> This ePortfolio showcases the culmination of my experience and achievements throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights growth, technical experience, and most importantly problem solving. Below are three artifacts that I feel show my proficiency with the outcomes of this program.    </p>

<section id="Self-Assessment">
  <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p> It is crucial to have a current and updated ePortofolio when maintaining a career in software development. This will be a place to showcase skills and strengths that have shaped me into the programmer I am today. Before starting my program here at SNHU, I was a student at The University of Central Florida in the Computer Science program. There, I learned the fundamentals of programming in different languages. Creating small projects of tik-tac-toe games with C++ or using MySQL to create databases for small businesses to help maintain their inventory. After a year at UCF, I transferred to SNHU looking for an online computer science program. With each course in SNHU's program, I could showcase my grwoth by reinforcing my hard and soft skills. Building on top of the fundamentals I created at UCF. This is where I started learning MongoDB which allowed me to create an Android Studio database app that showcases a warehouse inventory. Implementing CRUD functions allows users to delete and edit selections inside the app itself. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> Between both schools, I noticed one thing specifically: always having a place where you can discuss and bounce ideas off of people with the same background as yourself. Mainly at UCF, I was able to work with small groups and collaborate on projects. This is where I learned how to work effectively with others to deliver high-quality code. The projects we worked on helped strengthen my teamwork abilities, teaching me how to divide responsibilities, manage different code structures, and make sure communication was clear and easy to understand between each party. In real-world environments, collaborating with clients and other developers will be second nature thanks to the SCRUM classes I have taken and my experience working with teams to deliver projects. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> While being able to work as a team has shown me how to grow as a developer, working on projects by myself has let me soar and utilize the best practices in computer science. Focusing on the Software Development Lifecycle and fully has been a guiding framework in each class here at SNHU. This helped me understand how to plan, design, develop, test, and deploy functional software and following the SDLC principles to define requirements for both back-end and front-end development.   </p>
  <p> This ePortfolio demonstrates my readiness to enter the workforce, highlighting my ability to develop secure and functional software of different levels all while following industry standard coding practices. I am confident that the skills I have developed over the past 4 years in the computer science program reflect my ability to create quality products and make myself an essential aspect of a software development team.  </p>
