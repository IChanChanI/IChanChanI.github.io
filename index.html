<section id="Welcome">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p> This ePortfolio showcases the culmination of my experience and achievements throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights growth, technical experience, and most importantly problem solving. Below are three artifacts that I feel show my proficiency with the outcomes of this program.    </p>

<section id="Self-Assessment">
  <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p> It is crucial to have a current and updated ePortofolio when maintaining a career in software development. This will be a place to showcase skills and strengths that have shaped me into the programmer I am today. Before starting my program here at SNHU, I was a student at The University of Central Florida in the Computer Science program. There, I learned the fundamentals of programming in different languages. Creating small projects of Tic-Tac-Toe games with C++ or using MySQL to create databases for small businesses to help maintain their inventory. After a year at UCF, I transferred to SNHU looking for an online computer science program. With each course in SNHU's program, I could showcase my growth by reinforcing my hard and soft skills. Building on top of the fundamentals I created at UCF. This is where I started learning MongoDB which allowed me to create an Android Studio database app that showcases a warehouse inventory. Implementing CRUD functions allows users to delete and edit selections inside the app itself. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> Between both schools, I noticed one thing specifically: always having a place where you can discuss and bounce ideas off of people with the same background as yourself. Mainly at UCF, I was able to work with small groups and collaborate on projects. This is where I learned how to work effectively with others to deliver high-quality code. The projects we worked on helped strengthen my teamwork abilities, teaching me how to divide responsibilities, manage different code structures, and make sure communication was clear and easy to understand between each party. In real-world environments, collaborating with clients and other developers will be second nature thanks to the SCRUM classes I have taken and my experience working with teams to deliver projects. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> While being able to work as a team has shown me how to grow as a developer, working on projects by myself has let me soar and utilize the best practices in computer science. Focusing on the Software Development Lifecycle has been a guiding framework in each class here at SNHU. This helped me understand how to plan, design, develop, test, and deploy functional software and follow the SDLC principles to define requirements for both back-end and front-end development.   </p>
  <p> This ePortfolio demonstrates my readiness to enter the workforce, highlighting my ability to develop secure and functional software of different levels all while following industry standard coding practices. I am confident that the skills I have developed over the past 4 years in the computer science program reflect my ability to create quality products and make myself an essential aspect of a software development team.  </p>

  <h2>Code Review</h2>
  <p> In the world of computer science, it is important to understand have have the ability to create code reviews. This helps articulate plans and communicate with your peers on plans for projects being worked on. Below is a code review of the three artifacts highlighting my plan on how I am going to enhance each one.  </p>

  <h2>Artifacts</h2>
  <p>Below are three artifacts that I have chosen to showcase the different skills I have learned throughout the CS program that I feel aligned with the learning outcomes of the CS-499 Capstone.</p>

  <h3> Software Design </h3>
  
  <p><strong>Artifact 1:</strong> Snake Game Translation</p>
  <p> This artifact was chosen to showcase my skills in software design. For this project, I wanted to take a simple snake game I created at the beginning of my computer science program and enhance it. </p>
  <img src="images/OriginalSnake.png" alt="Original Snake Game Screenshot" width="300">
  <p> I started with a program originally coded in C++ that couldn't function properly due to the poorly designed code and lack of comments to organize different sections. To showcase my skills in software design, I wanted to completely transfer the original code to Java while also adding more features.</p>
  <p> With the transition to Java, allows for a better design for the game and adds the ability to create new features such as a difficulty selector, pause function, and a high score. Allowing the player more freedom and replayability.</p>

  <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
  <p><strong>Artifact 2:</strong> 3-D Render's with C++</p>
  <p> To showcase my ability to adapt to different algorithms and data structures, I chose a project from CS-330 at SNHU. Where we learned to create 3-D objects and render scenes with C++ and Visual Code. The original project was a simple render of shapes that was flat and unresponsive.  </p>
  <img src="images/Orignal Shape.png" alt="Original Snake Game Screenshot" width="300">
  <p> From the beginning of this course, I wanted to use this project to showcase my skills in creating a more interactive environment. To do so, I added different levels of immersion. First, the ability to move around the scene using keyboard and mouse functions. Then adding moveable functions to the shapes. Each shape has its own axis that it rotates on during the render. After that, I wanted to add something that would catch the eyes of the users, so I added shape-shifting to the three shapes using a matrix multiplication changing the size of each shape.  </p>
  <img src="images/ShapeUpdated.gif" alt="Original Snake Game Screenshot" width="300">
  <p> Adding these features demonstrated my knowledge of different forms of algorithms and data structures while also showcasing my ability to learn new ways to implement learned skills. </p>

  
  <h3>Databases</h3>
  <p><strong>Artifact 3:</strong> Austin Animal Shelter Database</p>
  <p> For the third and final artifact, I needed to show my ability to work on databases. Here at SNHU, we have learned a lot about working with MongoDB and MySQL, but they are all mostly on virtual machines that we have to use and can't really store anything locally. That is why I decided to use the web application from CS-340 called Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter Dashboard. This is the perfect artifact to demonstrate my skills with databases. Since this was originally stored on a virtual machine provided by the school, I wanted to show off my skills by recreating the entire system, dashboard, connection to a database, and web design all locally. </p>
  <p> Since the Apporto platform we used as the virtual machine was Linux, I needed to translate all the code into Python for it to work with Windows. Using a Dash Framework and MongoDB, I was able to re-create the entire system and tweak the design to make it more functional as well.  </p>
  <img src="images/DataBase.png" alt="Original Snake Game Screenshot" width="600">
  <p> Recreating this project locally, demonstrates my skills in developing a multi-leveled web application that connects with PyMongo servers all while using a Dash Framework that updates seamlessly with a set of data. </p>
  <p> By implementing a CRUD model into the framework, we can delete, edit, create, and read different assets in the datasets. </p>
